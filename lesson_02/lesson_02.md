        <h1>Lesson 02 - Drivers</h1>
        <p>
            Now before we begin writing code to automate the browser, we need to learn what a <strong><em>driver</em></strong> is.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a Driver?</h2>
        <p>
            In Selenium and other web automation frameworks, a <strong><em>driver</em></strong> 
            "drives a browser natively, as a user would, either locally or on a remote machine"
            <sub><a href="source-1">1</a></sub>.
            <br><br>
            Think of a driver like a person operating a car. Without a driver, most cars won’t go anywhere on their own. 
            In the same way, your web browser needs a driver to follow instructions. 
            As the "driver," you’ll write code that tells the browser what to do—similar to how shifting into gear, pressing the gas, and steering will guide a car to your destination.
