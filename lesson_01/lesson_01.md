      Whether you're looking to start a career in software testing or simply want to automate repetitive tasks in your browser, Selenium is a powerful tool that lets you write code to control and interact with web applications just like a real user would.
      </br></br>
      While there are many automation tools available today, Selenium stands out for its long-standing reputation, active open-source community, and extensive support for different browsers and programming languages. These qualities make it one of the most widely adopted solutions in the field of browser automation.
